                <p>They say the moon sees everything, but tonight, I think it only watches us. It has seen a thousand lifetimes, yet it feels like it’s never seen a love as quiet and as deep as the one I hold for you.</p>

                <p>If I could reach up and pull the stars from the sky, I would arrange them to spell out every word I’ve ever been too breathless to say. You aren't just a person to me; you are the light that guides me home when the world goes dark.</p>
