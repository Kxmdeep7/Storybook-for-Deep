                <p>Deep, every quiet moment reminds me of you. <br>
                Even when the world is busy, my heart finds its way back to you. <br>
                There’s a calm in thinking of you that nothing else can bring.</p>

                <p>Walking beside you, I realize that love is not about grand gestures. <br>
                It’s in the way your smile lights the room, <br>
                The way your presence makes even silence feel alive. <br>
                I promise to be someone who keeps your heart safe.</p>

                <p>I’ve always been afraid of being truly seen, <br>
                But with you, that fear turns into peace. <br>
                You love even the parts of me I try to hide. <br>
                You are the calm in my storms, the warmth in my night.</p>

                Sleep peacefully, knowing you are loved, <br>
