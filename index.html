    <h1>The First Whisper 💫</h1>
    <p>The rain falls quietly, as if hiding the world, leaving only us in soft embrace.</p>
    <p>Some memories never grow old; they just sit quietly in a corner of the heart.</p>

  <section class="page">
    <h1>The Unspoken Promise 💖</h1>
    <p>We walk together without a destination, yet every step feels like home.</p>
    <p>In your laughter, I see my whole world. When you are near, even time seems to stand still.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Page 3 -->
  <section class="page">
    <h1>Emotional Honesty 🌿</h1>
    <p>I was always afraid of being truly known. But with you, fear became a strange kind of peace.</p>
    <p>You sat with me in the dark, loving every part of me, even the shadows I tried to hide.</p>

  <section class="page" id="final-page">
    <h1>Quiet Ending 🌙</h1>
    <p>You are my favorite “once upon a time,” and I hope you are my “ever after.”</p>
    <p>Sleep peacefully, knowing you are loved, even when the world feels heavy.</p>
    <p><em>In every heartbeat, you are there… ❤️</em></p>
